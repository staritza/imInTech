      <h3> Technology for the people by the people</h3>
      <p>I'm In Tech is a community that aims to train young Africans in technology and business,
      to empower them to be able to provide solutions that the continent needs, tailored for the continent.</p>
      <p>Often times, technology used in Africa is technology developed in some other countries by some other people, for
      some other purpose, and then repurposed for use in Africa.</p>
      <p>While there is no use in reinventing the wheel, I'm In Tech believes that sometimes, solutions do need to be
      tailored for specific needs, and wants to empower young Africans to be the solutions to the problems the continent
      faces.</p>
      <p>We aim at the younger generation, because we believe that they are more impressionable, and they have the
      energy and drive that Africa needs to progress.</p>
      <p>To achieve this mission, we will hold training sessions that teach attendants to develop apps, create websites,
      start their own businesses, in order to give them the tools they need to leverage technology, start their own
      businesses, bringing growth and progress to the continent.</p>
      <p>We will start in Ghana, then move on to other African nations.</p>
